# Training environment setup
This training setup is an environment to do javascript exercizes, dive deeper into SCSS, sprite generation, and so on. Uploaded to GitHub to be able to continue working on the go, at home and at work.

## Credits
The original setup (folder structure, sprite generation, gulp file, etc) are all courtesy of the wonderful FE developers at Emakina.
